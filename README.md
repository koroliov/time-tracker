# Time Tracker

## Tool to track work time with an inuitive interface

### General Principles

It works in a web browser, uses `localStorage` to save/restore data.  The path
to the saved file will be used as the address for the `localStorage`. This way
it's possible to track time separately (if needed, e.g.  if working for
different employers) and to open previously exported data w/o overwriting the
current data.

### How to use

The user needs to save the dist/time-tracker.html file somewhere on the local
file system, then open the saved file in a web browser and use the tool.
